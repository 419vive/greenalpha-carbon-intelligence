# 📋 IEEE Fraud Detection Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Mission
Develop advanced machine learning models to detect fraudulent e-commerce transactions using SERENA MCP-powered development, targeting maximum ROC-AUC while minimizing false positives that harm customer experience.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### Core Documents
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Main project documentation and setup guide
- **[IDEATION_PLANNING.md](../IDEATION_PLANNING.md)** - 🧠 **Comprehensive strategy and implementation plan**
