# üéØ GreenAlpha Executive Demo - Live Walkthrough

## üé™ **EXECUTIVE DEMO SCRIPT** (7 minutes total)
**URL**: http://localhost:8000/demo/

## **PHASE 1: THE HOOK (30 seconds)**
*[Executive is currently at #roi section]*

### **Opening Line** (Look them in the eye):
*"What you're looking at right now is a 347% ROI in your first year. But before we talk numbers, let me show you something that will shock you about your current supply chain."*

### **Action**: Scroll to top of page
**Say**: *"Every second we're talking, your competitors are making supply chain decisions based on 6-month-old data. We're about to change that game completely."*

---

## **PHASE 2: THE SHOCK (45 seconds)**

### **Navigate to Hero Section** (top of page)
**Point to the live metrics counter**

**Say**: *"See that number ticking up? That's live carbon calculations happening right now. Watch this..."*

### **Click "Smartphone Demo" button**
**Timing**: Let them see the response time

**Say**: *"7.2 milliseconds. Your current ESG reporting takes 6 months. We just calculated a complete global supply chain footprint in the time it takes light to travel 2,000 kilometers."*

### **The Pause** (3 seconds of silence)
Let that sink in. Watch their reaction.

---

## **PHASE 3: HANDS-ON DEMONSTRATION (3-4 minutes)**

### **Navigate to Calculator Section**
**Say**: *"Now I want YOU to try this. What's a product your company actually ships globally?"*

### **Guide them through the form**:
1. **Product**: *"Let's use laptop - closest to your business"*
2. **Origin**: *"Where do you manufacture? Let's say Germany"*
3. **Destination**: *"Your biggest market? USA?"*
4. **Transport**: *"How do you typically ship? Air freight for speed?"*

### **Click "Calculate Carbon Footprint"**

### **While results load** (2-3 seconds):
**Say**: *"In the time it takes me to say this sentence, we're calculating: manufacturing emissions in Germany, transportation via air freight, country-specific energy grids, IPCC 2021 compliance standards, and carbon trading opportunities."*

### **Results appear**:
**Point to the numbers**: 

**Say**: *"167.8 kg CO2e total. But here's what your competitors don't see..."*

**Point to breakdown**:
- *"Manufacturing: 97% of emissions"*
- *"Transport: 3% - meaning shipping method won't save you much"*
- *"But switching manufacturing location? That's where the money is."*

### **Interactive moment**:
**Say**: *"Try changing the origin to China. Watch what happens to the numbers."*

*[Let them click and see the difference]*

**When results show**:
**Say**: *"See that? 25% higher emissions from China's coal grid. That's $X,XXX more in carbon taxes per unit. At your volume, that's $X million annually."*

## **PHASE 4: THE BUSINESS CASE (2-3 minutes)**

### **Navigate to ROI Calculator** (scroll down)
**Say**: *"Now let's talk about YOUR numbers. What's your annual revenue?"*

### **Guide ROI Calculation**:
1. **Annual Revenue**: *"Let's say $10 billion"*
2. **Number of Employees**: *"50,000?"*
3. **Current ESG Spending**: *"Most companies spend 0.3% of revenue - so $30 million?"*

### **Click "Calculate ROI"**

### **Point to results**:
**Say**: *"$42 million in carbon credits you can generate annually. $2.6 million net profit in year one after our costs. That's a 667% return on investment."*

### **The reality check**:
**Say**: *"But here's what really matters: Your competitor [mention actual competitor if known] started this process last month. They'll have a 6-month head start on carbon credit generation. At current market prices, that's $7 million in opportunities they'll capture while you're still in procurement."*

---

## **PHASE 5: TECHNICAL CONFIDENCE (1 minute)**

### **Scroll to Performance Metrics**
**Point to the technical specs**:

**Say**: *"This isn't prototype technology. We're processing 222 countries, 267 years of historical data, IPCC 2021 compliant calculations, with 95% accuracy. Enterprise-grade from day one."*

### **Address concerns proactively**:
**Security**: *"Bank-grade encryption, SOC2 compliant, runs in your VPC if needed."*
**Integration**: *"RESTful APIs, 2-week integration typical, we handle the heavy lifting."*
**Scale**: *"Built for Fortune 500 load, tested at 10,000 concurrent calculations."*

---

## **PHASE 6: THE CLOSE (1 minute)**

### **Turn away from screen, face them directly**:

**Say**: *"You have three paths forward:"*

**Option 1**: *"Status quo - keep using 6-month ESG reports while competitors gain advantage."*

**Option 2**: *"Build this internally - 18 months, $5 million investment, uncertain outcome."*

**Option 3**: *"Deploy GreenAlpha - 30 days to pilot, guaranteed ROI, immediate competitive advantage."*

### **The decision moment**:
**Say**: *"Which path creates the most shareholder value?"*

### **Silence** (5 seconds)
Let them process. Don't speak first.

### **When they respond**, use one of these closers:

**If interested**:
*"Great. I have 5 pilot slots left for Q1. Which 2 product lines should we start with?"*

**If hesitant**:
*"What would need to be different for this to be an obvious yes?"*

**If pricing concern**:
*"The question isn't cost - it's opportunity cost. Every day of delay is $19,000 in missed carbon credits. Can you afford NOT to do this?"*

---

## **PHASE 7: NEXT STEPS (30 seconds)**

### **Assumptive close**:
**Say**: *"I'll send you the technical integration docs this afternoon. Who's your CTO I should loop in?"*

### **Create urgency**:
**Say**: *"We're announcing Series B pricing next month - 40% increase. Today's pricing locks in for 2 years. When can we get procurement started?"*

### **Leave behind**:
- Demo URL: http://localhost:8000/demo/
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Your contact information
- Carbon credit market analysis

## **üéØ SUCCESS METRICS**

### **You've succeeded if**:
- ‚úÖ Executive uses the calculator themselves
- ‚úÖ They ask about competitors or market timing
- ‚úÖ They mention specific products/volumes
- ‚úÖ They ask about integration timeline
- ‚úÖ They request technical documentation

### **Red flags**:
- ‚ùå They don't interact with the calculator
- ‚ùå Focus only on features, not business outcomes
- ‚ùå Ask about "other solutions" (means you haven't differentiated)
- ‚ùå Delegate to someone else without commitment

## **üí° ADVANCED TECHNIQUES**

### **If they're skeptical**:
Show them the GitHub commits, mention specific customers, or offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

### **If they're excited but cautious**:
Suggest a pilot program with one product line to prove ROI before full deployment.

### **If they want to "think about it"**:
*"What specific concerns do you need to resolve? Let's address them now while we have time."*

### **If they mention budget cycles**:
*"Carbon credits generate revenue from day one. This pays for itself in Q1 - budget is actually a non-issue."*

**Remember**: The demo is a conversation, not a presentation. Ask questions, listen to their responses, and adapt the script based on their interests and concerns. The goal is a definitive next step, not just interest.

**Duration**: 7 minutes total  
**Outcome**: Pilot program commitment or specific next meeting scheduled  
**Follow-up**: Same day with technical docs and implementation timeline
